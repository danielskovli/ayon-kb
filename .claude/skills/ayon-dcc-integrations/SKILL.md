# Ayon DCC & service integrations

Each supported DCC is a separate repo at `github.com/ynput/ayon-<host>`.
Structure follows the addon pattern (see `ayon-addon-development`) plus
the host pattern (see `ayon-host-integration`).

## Conventions inside a DCC addon

- `client/ayon_<host>/api/` — all `import <dcc>` calls stay here; keep
  module-top-level imports lazy.
- `client/ayon_<host>/startup/` — whatever the DCC runs at boot
  (`userSetup.py` for Maya, `menu.py` for Nuke, etc.).
- `client/ayon_<host>/hooks/` — `PreLaunchHook` / `PostLaunchHook`.
- `client/ayon_<host>/plugins/{create,load,publish,inventory}/` —
  host-scoped plugins (filter via class attr `hosts = ["<host>"]`).
- Depends on `ayon-applications` (launch env) and `ayon-core` (pipeline
  glue).

## `ayon-applications`

Central addon that defines `Application` and `ApplicationManager`. Used by
the launcher to:

- list available apps per project
- compose env vars (with per-host hooks)
- spawn the DCC subprocess
- handle workfile templating

For a brand-new DCC you either extend `ayon-applications` or define an
app group in its settings.

## Adding a new host — short checklist

See `ayon-host-integration` for the full playbook.

1. Scaffold an addon.
2. Implement `HostBase` + `IWorkfileHost` + `ILoadHost` + `IPublishHost`.
3. Write at least one `PreLaunchHook` (env + Python path).
4. Bootstrap under `startup/` — `install_host(YourHost())` + menu wiring.
5. Ship at minimum: a `Creator` for `workfile`, a workfile collector, one
   `LoaderPlugin` per supported representation format.
6. Declare the app in `ayon-applications` (or extend).
7. Upload + dev bundle + test via `ayon --use-dev`.

## Reading tips

- Features missing in `ayon-core` that work in Maya live in
  `ayon-maya/client/ayon_maya/api/`.
- New representation type? Copy a similar plugin in
  `ayon-core/client/ayon_core/plugins/publish/` and specialise.
- DCC bootstrap differs wildly — always inspect `startup/` of the nearest
  existing host.

## Artist help articles per DCC

Each DCC has a "Working with <X> in AYON" + (usually) a settings article
at `help.ayon.app/en/collections/1925761-dcc-integrations`. See
`13-resources.md` in the KB root for the full URL index.
